### âž¥ Windows Manager 
- Windows comes with Floating/Stacking Windows Manager, which can get really messy if working with multiple apps at once.

- We will use [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm), which will solve it.

### âž¥  Spotfiy
-  [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation/) is pretty cool spotify modification if you want to customize your spotify, my recomendation is `text theme` with `RosePineDown` color pallet.
