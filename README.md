### ➥ Windows Manager 
- Not sure who likes it but stacking/floating windows managers sucks so do Windows one (i'm the only hater  💢).
- So to solve this annoying problem we will use revolutionary [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm) 👅

<details>
    <summary>Example 😏</summary>
    <img src='example-twmr.png' />
    - We will use this and everyone will ask us how can we be so cool (aura) <br />
    
</details>

### ➥ Taskbar
- We won't be using default windows taskbar since it's bot very much customizable.
- Instead we will use [ZEBAR](https://github.com/glzr-io/zebar), now it comes with GlazeWM not sure how it will be in future, if they change it figure it out 😛
- Also we will use [Buttery Taskbar](https://github.com/LuisThiamNye/ButteryTaskbar2) which will just hide our old Windows Taskbar >w<

### ➥ PowerToys
-  [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), is Microsoft application that allows you to add cool features to Windows that doesn't come pre-installed. 
- let's not think about it as extra bloat (it is i'm using only 2 features from it... 😀)

<details>
    <summary>Example 😶</summary>
    - Istg you are <b>LAZY ASS</b> 😤, go search PowerToys yourself it's one of the most popular Windows tools OMG.  <br />
    - I ain't adding a example of PowerToys (we saving github storage with this one [give me copilot for free plspslsdfldsj🤗]).

## `🔨` | Configuration
- Okay here we are cooking the main souce, so download the stuff we were talking (if you didn't read my description of the apps you will get executed 👿)

- Sooo... if you didn't yet clone this repo clone it now somewhere where you will be able to find it 👧 (documents if you are dumb and can't think)

### ➥ GlazeWM
- Alright so navigate to `%userprofile%/.glzr` and go folder named `glazewm`. Now open another explorer and go to the `cloned repo => bin => glazewm` and copy `config.yaml` to the original `glazewm` folder and BANG 🔫, you have configured GlazeWM with my configuration 😲

<details>
    <summary>Keybinds ⌨</summary>
